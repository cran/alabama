           Changes in "alabama" version 2010.10-1
  
  o Added the Hessian computation in `auglag'.  

  o Added checks for the first- and second-order KKT conditions in `auglag'.  

  o Two of the convergence messages in `constrOptim.nl' where eliminated, because these were misleading.


           Changes in "alabama" version 2011.3-1

  o Fixed a bug in `auglag' related to KKT2 condition when eigenvalues of Hessian can be complex numbers.  
	This bug occured in 3 functions: auglag1, auglag2, and auglag3.
